# Fluent UI Recipes

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joey Jiron. I work at Microsoft and build applications using Fluent UI React. There are a lot of UI patterns that I see in the applications I build and got tired of repeating myself. That's why I built this repo, to capture all my Fluent UI recipes for React that I can share between projects.

If you find this project useful, please star it and feel free to submit a pull request.

**Features:**

- âœ… Built entirely with Fluent UI React
- âœ… 0 dependencies (other than fluentui-react and fluentui icons)
- âœ… Many variants of the same component

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ astro/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ react/
â””â”€â”€â”€â””â”€â”€ pages/
```

- `src/pages` is where all the pages for the site live
- `src/astro` contains all the code specific to astro
- `src/react` this is where the bulk of the code lives and all the code for components
